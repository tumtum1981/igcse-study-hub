IGCSE STUDY HUB - RECOMMENDATIONS REPORT
==========================================
February 2026 | Based on review of CLAUDE.md and passover documentation


PART A: WORKFLOW IMPROVEMENTS
==============================

1. INCONSISTENT TEST COUNTS PER BLOCK
--------------------------------------
Problem: Test counts vary significantly across blocks with no clear
standard. Some topics have 3 tests, others have 1 or 2. Some blocks
have 5 summary tests, the newest has 3. Some blocks have exam-style
tests, most don't.

Current state:
  Biology Block 1:  23 tests (3 per topic + 3 exam + 5 summary)
  Biology Block 2:  17 tests (3 per topic + 5 summary, no exam)
  Biology Block 3:  18 tests (3 per topic except diet=1 + 5 summary)
  Chemistry Block 1: 19 tests (3 per topic except ions=2 + 5 summary)
  Chemistry Block 2: 17 tests (3/3/3/1/2 per topic + 5 summary)
  Chemistry Block 3: 20 tests (3 per topic + 5 summary)
  Physics Block 1:  21 tests (3 per topic except work=1 + 3 exam + 5 summary)
  Physics Block 2:  20 tests (3 per topic + 5 summary)
  Physics Block 3:  11 tests (2 per topic + 3 summary)
  Sep Bio Block 1:  25 tests (3 per topic + 5 exam + 5 summary)

Recommendation: Standardise going forward. Suggested standard:
  - 2 topic tests per content page (sufficient for revision)
  - 3 summary tests per block
  - Exam-style tests optional (add when time allows)
  This gives a predictable 2T+3 per block (e.g. 5 topics = 13 tests).
  Update CLAUDE.md to reflect the chosen standard.


2. PASSOVER DOCUMENT STRUCTURE
-------------------------------
Problem: The passover document mixes reference material with a
development log. Session entries appear both within and after the
"Maintenance Notes" section, breaking the document flow. Some session
entries are grouped under --- dividers inconsistently.

Recommendation: Reorganise the passover document:
  - Move ALL session entries to a single "Development Log" section at
    the end, in chronological order
  - Keep reference sections (Structure, Features, Maintenance Notes)
    together at the top
  - Remove duplicate information (maintenance notes partially repeat
    what's in CLAUDE.md)


3. CLAUDE.MD HAS SOME OUTDATED REFERENCES
-------------------------------------------
Problem: The "refresh website block" command in CLAUDE.md mentions
checking if the homepage needs block count updates, but it also says
to check tests/index.html - however, tests are added separately, not
as part of "refresh website block". The passover description in
line 137 still says "Each block has topic tests (3 per topic)" which
no longer matches the newer blocks (Physics Block 3 uses 2 per topic).

Recommendation:
  - Clarify that "refresh website block" is content-only; tests are a
    separate step
  - Update the Quick Tests description to reflect variable test counts
  - Consider adding an "add tests" command to CLAUDE.md as a formal
    step, parallel to "refresh website block"


4. NO AUTOMATED VERIFICATION
------------------------------
Problem: Every time content or tests are added, multiple files must be
manually checked for consistency (nav chains, file counts, index
listings). Session 14 was entirely dedicated to fixing accumulated
inconsistencies from earlier sessions.

Recommendation: Create a simple verification script (e.g. verify.js
or verify.py) that checks:
  - Every test directory: file count matches hub card count
  - Every test file: has exactly 20 questions, has 5A/5B/5C/5D
  - Nav chain integrity: every "next" has a matching "prev"
  - Block indexes list every HTML file in their directory
  - Search index has entries for every content page
  Run this after each session to catch drift before it accumulates.


5. GIT REPOSITORY SCOPE
-------------------------
Problem: The git repo is igcse-study-hub/ but CLAUDE.md and the
passover document live outside it (in the parent homeschool/ folder).
This means documentation changes aren't version-controlled alongside
the code they describe.

Recommendation: Either:
  a) Move CLAUDE.md and passover/ into the igcse-study-hub/ repo, or
  b) Create a separate repo for the parent homeschool/ directory, or
  c) Accept the current setup but be aware that documentation history
     isn't tracked in git


PART B: WEBSITE FEATURE IMPROVEMENTS
======================================

1. SPACED REPETITION / SMART REVIEW
-------------------------------------
The dashboard tracks test scores and confidence ratings, but doesn't
use them to guide study. A "What to study next" feature could:
  - Highlight topics rated "Need Practice"
  - Suggest retaking tests where scores were below 70%
  - Prioritise topics not visited recently
  - Show a simple daily study plan on the dashboard
This would make the existing Supabase data more actionable.


2. QUESTION BANK WITH RANDOMISATION
-------------------------------------
Currently each test has fixed questions in a fixed order. Students who
retake a test may memorise the answers. Options:
  - Add a "Random Test" mode that pulls 20 random questions from a
    topic's question pool
  - Store questions in a JSON file per block, select randomly at runtime
  - This would also make it easier to add questions without creating
    whole new test files


3. TIMED TEST MODE
--------------------
IGCSE exams are timed. Adding an optional timer to tests would help
with exam preparation:
  - Countdown timer (e.g. 20 minutes for 20 questions)
  - Auto-submit when time runs out
  - Show time taken in results
  - Track average time per question on dashboard


4. EXPLANATION FOR WRONG ANSWERS
----------------------------------
Currently tests show correct/incorrect but don't explain why. Adding a
brief explanation for each question (shown after submission) would turn
tests into a learning tool, not just an assessment tool.


5. TOPIC PROGRESS VISUALISATION
---------------------------------
The dashboard has subject breakdowns but no visual map of coverage.
A topic grid or progress heatmap showing:
  - Green: confident + high test scores
  - Amber: learning or mixed scores
  - Red: need practice or untested
  - Grey: no data yet
This gives an at-a-glance view of revision gaps.


6. PRINT-FRIENDLY REVISION SHEETS
------------------------------------
The formula sheet is already print-friendly. Extending this to content
pages would let students print topic summaries for offline revision:
  - Add print CSS that hides nav, footer, quiz answers, and test links
  - Keep key terms, tables, formulas, and diagrams
  - One clean page per topic


7. FLASHCARD MODE
-------------------
Reuse the existing key terms and quiz questions as interactive
flashcards:
  - Show term/question on front, definition/answer on back
  - Click/tap to flip
  - Mark as "know it" or "study again"
  - Could be generated from existing page content without new data entry


8. OFFLINE / PWA SUPPORT
--------------------------
As a static site, this is a good candidate for a Progressive Web App:
  - Service worker for offline access
  - "Add to Home Screen" on mobile
  - Cache content pages and tests for study without internet
  - Sync scores when back online


9. MORE SVG DIAGRAMS
----------------------
Only 11 pages currently have SVG diagrams (from Session 8). Priority
candidates for diagrams:
  - Chemistry: states of matter particle model, ionic/covalent structure
  - Biology: osmosis/diffusion through membrane, cell division
  - Physics: energy Sankey diagrams, force diagrams, moment calculations
  Diagrams significantly aid visual learners and are common in IGCSE
  marking schemes.


10. INTER-SUBJECT TOPIC LINKS
-------------------------------
Some topics connect across subjects (e.g. energy in physics and biology,
particles in chemistry and physics). Adding "Related Topics" links at
the bottom of content pages would help students make connections and
support the integrated science approach of IGCSE.


PRIORITY RANKING (suggested order of implementation)
-----------------------------------------------------
High impact, low effort:
  1. Verification script (prevents accumulated bugs)
  2. Print-friendly content pages (CSS-only change)
  3. Standardise test counts in CLAUDE.md

Medium impact, medium effort:
  4. Explanations for test answers
  5. "What to study next" on dashboard
  6. Topic progress heatmap
  7. More SVG diagrams

High impact, high effort:
  8. Question bank with randomisation
  9. Timed test mode
  10. Flashcard mode
  11. PWA / offline support
