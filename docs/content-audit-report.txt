IGCSE Study Hub - Content Audit Report
Source Slides vs Website Pages
Generated: February 2026
=======================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
A systematic comparison of all 49 content pages against their original source
PowerPoint/PDF slides revealed several categories of issues:

- 1 CRITICAL MISMATCH: Wrong topic entirely (Biology Block 2, Page 5)
- 1 page with NO source slide (Biology Block 2, Page 3)
- 5 Separate Biology pages with significant content deviations
- Several pages with minor supplementary content added beyond source slides
- 1 AI generation artifact (Chemistry Block 3, Page 2)

Clean blocks (all pages MATCH their sources):
- Biology Block 1, Biology Block 3
- Chemistry Block 1, Chemistry Block 3
- Physics Block 1, Physics Block 3

BIOLOGY
=======================================================================

BLOCK 1 (5 slides -> 5 pages)
------------------------------
01-cells.html              <- B1.1.1 cells                    MATCH
02-specialised-cells.html  <- B1.2.1 specialised cells        MATCH
03-magnification.html      <- B1.3.1 Magnification            MATCH
04-living-organisms.html   <- B1.4.1 living organisms         MATCH
05-prokaryotic-cells.html  <- B1.5.1 Prokaryotic cells        MATCH

BLOCK 2 (4 slides -> 5 pages) *** PROBLEMS ***
------------------------------------------------
01-size-of-cells.html      <- Session 1 size of cells         PARTIAL
  - Core SA:V content matches
  - Added: Villi/microvilli, alveoli, root hair cells section (possibly supplementary)

02-diffusion.html          <- Session 2 Diffusion             MATCH

03-osmosis.html            <- NO SOURCE SLIDE EXISTS           PARTIAL
  - There are only 4 PPTX files for Block 2 (sessions 1,2,4,5) - no session 3
  - Week 3 was "Osmosis investigation" per course objectives (practical-based, no slides)
  - Page content is accurate IGCSE osmosis material but entirely generated from
    curriculum knowledge, not from specific tutor slides
  - SVG diagram REVERTED (pending resolution)

04-osmosis-practical.html  <- Session 4 osmosis practical     PARTIAL
  - Data analysis section matches the "Analysing data" focus of the slide
  - Detailed method section may overlap with unrecorded week 3

05-active-transport.html   <- Session 5 diffusion investigation   *** MISMATCH ***
  - CRITICAL: Page topic is "Active Transport" but source slide is
    "Investigating factors that affect diffusion"
  - Source slide covers: jelly cube experiments, temperature effects on diffusion,
    scientific variables (independent/dependent/control), predictions, methodology
  - Page instead covers: active transport definition, carrier proteins, ATP,
    comparison table (diffusion vs osmosis vs active transport)
  - The ENTIRE page content is fabricated from IGCSE curriculum, not from the source
  - The actual Session 5 content (diffusion investigation practical) is MISSING
    from the website entirely
  - Active transport IS in the Block 2 course objectives, but has no dedicated slide
  - SVG diagram REVERTED (pending resolution)

  ACTION NEEDED:
  - Replace page content with actual Session 5 material (diffusion investigation)
  - Decide what to do with Active Transport content (see suggestions below)

04-enzymes-continued.html     <- Session 4 Enzymes continued      PARTIAL
  - Heavy content overlap with page 3 (lock and key, factors, denaturation repeated)
  - New content for this page: enzyme naming (-ase suffix), metabolism definition

05-balanced-diet.html         <- Session 5 Balanced diet          MATCH

------------------------------
01-state-changes.html     <- Session 1 State changes              PARTIAL
  - Page content matches state changes topic
  - MISSING: Diffusion (listed in course objectives: "Describe changes of state
    and diffusion in terms of kinetic theory")
  - SVG diagram REVERTED (pending content review)

02-ionic-bonding.html     <- Sessions 2+3 combined                MATCH

  - No dedicated source slide; content comes from "bonding summary" portion
    of Session 5 + standard IGCSE specification content
  - Level of detail (full sections on diamond, graphite, SiO2, allotropes)
    likely exceeds what was in the source slide
  - SVG diagram REVERTED (pending content review)

=======================================================================
SEPARATE BIOLOGY
=======================================================================

BLOCK 1 (5 slides + 2 whiteboard PDFs -> 5 pages) *** SYSTEMIC ISSUES ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALL 5 pages show the same pattern of issues:

01-features-of-organisms.html  <- Session 1 features of organisms     PARTIAL
  - OMITS: Vertebrate/invertebrate classification and arthropod groups
    (the bulk of Session 1, Slides 7-29)
  - ADDS: Detailed kingdom feature tables with specifics not in slides
    (saprophytic nutrition, DNA free in cytoplasm, cellulose cell wall)

02-species-binomial.html       <- Session 2 Species and binomial      PARTIAL (best)
  - Core concepts well-sourced (species definition, binomial system, Panthera example)
  - ADDS: "Advantages of the Binomial System" section, extra species examples
    (Canis, Felis), specific mnemonic
  - OMITS: Hybrid examples (geep, zorse, liger, tigon)

03-evolutionary-trees.html     <- Session 3 evolutionary trees        PARTIAL (worst)
  - FABRICATES 4 of 5 evidence types: morphology, protein sequences,
    fossil record, embryo development. Source slides ONLY teach DNA/gene sequences
  - OMITS: The entire gene sequencing practical (whale/cow/hippo DNA comparison)
    which forms ~2/3 of Session 3
  - Uses "phylogenetic tree" terminology (slides only say "evolutionary tree")

04-dichotomous-keys.html       <- Session 4 Dichotomous keys          PARTIAL
  - Uses FABRICATED invertebrate example key (slides use vertebrate classification)
  - ADDS: Etymology, formal guidelines, "Features to Avoid" table
  - OMITS: All practical exercises from slides and whiteboard PDF
    (penguin/bat/whale key, crab classification, marsupial identification)

05-plant-classification.html   <- Session 5 plant classification      PARTIAL
  - SUBSTITUTES conifers/gymnosperms for algae (slides teach algae as a plant
    group; the page replaces it with conifers -- this is a factual change)
  - ADDS: Xylem/phloem terminology, vascular bundle arrangement, root types
    (fibrous vs taproot) -- none in source slides
  - OMITS: Algae, all whiteboard PDF exam exercises

SYSTEMIC PATTERNS IN SEPARATE BIOLOGY:
1. Textbook supplementation: Every page adds formal definitions and structured
   tables not in the slides. Pages read like textbook summaries rather than
   reflections of lesson content.
2. Practical exercise omission: Every session's hands-on activities are absent.
3. Example substitution: Pages use different examples than the source slides.


=======================================================================
DIAGRAMS STATUS
=======================================================================

SVG diagrams were added to 10 pages in Session 20. After this audit:

KEPT (6 diagrams - pages with MATCH verdict):
- chemistry/block-1/02-states-of-matter.html   (particle arrangement)
- chemistry/block-2/04-metallic-bonding.html    (sea of electrons)
- biology/block-2/02-diffusion.html             (diffusion through membrane)
- physics/block-2/01-density.html               (particle packing comparison)
- physics/block-2/03-resultant-forces.html      (balanced vs unbalanced forces)
- physics/block-3/03-energy-resources.html      (Sankey diagram)

REVERTED (4 diagrams - pages with content issues):
- biology/block-2/03-osmosis.html               (no source slide)
- biology/block-2/05-active-transport.html      (wrong topic)
- chemistry/block-2/01-state-changes.html       (missing diffusion topic)
- chemistry/block-2/05-giant-covalent.html      (expanded beyond source)


=======================================================================
SUGGESTIONS FOR REMEDIATION
=======================================================================

1. "EXTRA LEARNING" PAGES
   When content has been added beyond what the source slides cover, rather than
   deleting it (since it may be valid IGCSE syllabus content), move it to a new
   "Extra Learning" page within the block. This preserves useful revision material
   while keeping the main lesson pages faithful to the actual slides taught.

   For example:
   - Biology Block 2: Active transport content -> extra-learning.html
   - Sep Bio Block 1: Fabricated evidence types, detailed kingdom tables,
     conifer content -> extra-learning.html per block
   - Chemistry Block 2: Giant covalent expanded detail could stay but be
     clearly marked as supplementary

   This approach:
   - Keeps slide-sourced pages accurate to what was taught
   - Retains IGCSE syllabus details that are useful for exam prep
   - Clearly separates "taught in lessons" from "extra revision material"

2. RAW SLIDES LINKS
   Add a link to the raw source slide (PPTX/PDF) next to each lesson link on the
   block index pages. This lets the student refer back to the original teaching
   material alongside the website summary.

   Implementation options:
   - Host slides in a /resources/ folder on the site (increases repo size)
   - Link to a shared drive/cloud folder containing the originals
   - Add a small icon/link next to each lesson in the block index.html

3. PRIORITY FIX LIST (ordered by severity):
   a. Biology Block 2 Page 5: Replace active transport with diffusion investigation
   b. Sep Bio Page 3: Fix fabricated evidence types (remove 4, keep DNA only)
   c. Sep Bio Page 5: Replace conifers with algae (matches source slides)
   d. Sep Bio Pages 1,4: Add missing vertebrate/invertebrate and practical content
   e. Chemistry Block 3 Page 2: Clean up AI artifact ("Wait, this doesn't work!")
   f. Chemistry Block 2 Page 1: Add missing diffusion content
   g. Review all Sep Bio pages for example substitutions

4. CONTENT ACCURACY NOTE
   Despite the structural issues, ALL page content across all 49 pages is
   factually accurate IGCSE material. No scientific errors were found. The
   issues are about sourcing (whether content came from the specific slides)
   rather than accuracy. Physics Block 3 in particular showed outstanding
   source fidelity with exact matching of worked examples and calculations.
